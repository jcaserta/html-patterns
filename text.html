  <div>How can you resist a book whose first chapter begins: “Have you ever peeked inside a friend’s trash can? I have.” Trash is like “one’s sex life,” the book continues, “the less said about it, the better.”

  	<div> Yet the Internet can convert this private affair into an object of public surveillance, and Evgeny Morozov tells you how. Cameras in your trash bin help determine if you are doing a good job of sorting recyclables. Your score is computed and, via the Net, is compared to the scores of other sorters. If you win, you will be rewarded with praise. Those doing a bad job will be subjected to social scorn. This is no technophobic nightmare. Project BinCam is already being studied in Britain and Germany.


  		<div>
  			The BinCam example encapsulates what Morozov, a contributing editor at The New Republic, will go on to discuss in “To Save Everything, Click Here.” The book crackles with intellectual energy and is encyclopedic in scope, examining the effects of technology on subjects ranging from politics to criminology to the endless quest to lose weight. One might wish for less breadth and more focus, however; often we barely have time to think about one topic when we are off to the next. Still, Morozov’s overall perspective is vital and important.

  			He derides an ideology he calls ­“Internet-centrism,” which defines the network not as a tool created by fallible human beings but as a creed to live by. The chief promoters of this ideology have projected upon the Internet certain values they imagine to be intrinsic, among them the imperatives to be open and transparent and efficient and digitally “social”; to believe that knowledge is created through data collection and algorithmic analysis; to believe that the minute quantification of existence is the path to self-awareness.

 
			<div>
  			In this Internet-centric view, the Net stands outside of history. It has brought us to an epochal moment — the culmination of all human invention. We therefore should live in accordance with its values. The Internet is a human creation; “the Internet” is a god to obey.
